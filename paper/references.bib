  abstract = {The classical capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) is a very popular combinatorial optimization problem in the field of logistics and supply chain management. Although CVRP has drawn interests of many researchers, no standard way has been established yet to obtain best known solutions for all the different problem sets. We propose an efficient algorithm Bilayer Local Search-based Particle Swarm Optimization (BLS-PSO) along with a novel decoding method to solve CVRP. Decoding method is important to relate the encoded particle position to a feasible CVRP solution. In bilayer local search, one layer of local search is for the whole population in any iteration whereas another one is applied only on the pool of the best particles generated in different generations. Such searching strategies help the BLS-PSO to perform better than the existing proposals by obtaining best known solutions for most of the existing benchmark problems within very reasonable computational time. Computational results also show that the performance achieved by the proposed algorithm outperforms other PSO-based approaches.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to introduce new design-criteria for next-generation hyperparameter optimization software. The criteria we propose include (1) define-by-run API that allows users to construct the parameter search space dynamically, (2) efficient implementation of both searching and pruning strategies, and (3) easy-to-setup, versatile architecture that can be deployed for various purposes, ranging from scalable distributed computing to light-weight experiment conducted via interactive interface. In order to prove our point, we will introduce Optuna, an optimization software which is a culmination of our effort in the development of a next generation optimization software. As an optimization software designed with define-by-run principle, Optuna is particularly the first of its kind. We will present the design-techniques that became necessary in the development of the software that meets the above criteria, and demonstrate the power of our new design through experimental results and real world applications.

  abstract = {Dedicated algorithm and modeling improvements continue to advance the state of the art with respect to vehicle routing problems (VRPs). Despite these academic achievements, solving large VRP instances sufficiently fast for real-life applicability remains challenging. By exploiting VRP solution characteristics in an effective manner, this paper arrives at a powerful and fast optimization heuristic. Its primary contributions are threefold: a ruin method, a recreate method, and a fleet minimization procedure. The ruin method functions via adjacent string removal, introducing with it a novel property regarding vehicle routing problems that we term spatial slack, whereas the recreate method is categorized as greedy insertion with blinks. Combining these results in slack induction by string removals (SISRs), a powerful ruin and recreate approach. The fleet minimization procedure, meanwhile, introduces an absences-based acceptance criterion that serves as a complementary optimization component for when minimizing the number of vehicles constitutes the primary VRP objective. Together these three elements provide a suite of simple, powerful, and easily reproducible algorithmic methods that are successfully applied not only to the capacitated VRP but also to a wide range of related problems such as pickup and delivery problems and others that include time windows. SISRs serves to strip back the layers of complexity and specialization synonymous with the trend of algorithmic development throughout recent decades. Moreover, such simplicity and reproducibility are shown to not necessarily come at the expense of solution quality, with SISRs consistently outperforming alternative general approaches as well as dedicated single-purpose methods. Finally, aside from performance-related criteria, SISRs also serves to showcase a fresh perspective with respect to VRPs more generally, introducing a range of new terminology and procedures that, it is hoped, will invigorate further research and innovation.},

  abstract = {The field of continuous optimisation has witnessed an explosion of the so-called new or novel metaheuristic algorithms. Though not all of these algorithms are efficient as proclaimed by their inventors, a few of them have proved to be very efficient and thus have become popular tools for solving complex optimisation problems. Therefore, there is a need for a systematic analysis approach to fairly evaluate and compare the results of some of these optimisation algorithms. In this paper, a set of well-known mathematical benchmark functions are compiled to provide an easily accessible collection of standard benchmark test problems for continuous global optimisation. This set of test problems are used to investigate the computational capabilities and the microscopic behaviour of twelve different metaheuristic algorithms. The required number of function evaluations for reaching the best solution and the run-time complexity of the algorithms are compared. Furthermore, statistical tests are conducted to validate the concluding remarks.},

  abstract = {The scheduling of deliveries and the routing of vehicles are of great importance for supply chain operations, as both determine to a great extent the distribution costs, as well as customer satisfaction. The fact that the distribution of goods is being affected by multiple factors, stemming from the demands of transportation companies, customers, and the external environment, has made the vehicle routing problem (VRP) among the most studied topics in operational research. These factors are transformed either to constraints or variables of the problem and finally lead to the creation of different variants of the VRP, formulated and studied by researchers. Moreover, the management of logistics and supply chain operations is being enhanced by the use of algorithms, integrated into information systems, enabling the optimization of real-life distribution cases. This paper presents a methodology for classifying the multiple VRP variants related to freight transportation, that most logistics and distribution companies face in their daily operations, as well as the algorithms solving the various problems. The application of the research methodology concluded to 334 papers, which were further sorted to 263 papers on the subject of freight transportation, aiming to identify the trends of the VRP variants and the applied algorithms, during the last decade. The correlation between the VRP variants and the applied algorithms is also identified. Finally, the paper presents the quantitative and qualitative results of the literature review and discusses the scientific publications with a significant impact on the research community.},

  abstract = {The recent research on the CVRP is being slowed down by the lack of a good set of benchmark instances. The existing sets suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks: (i) became too easy for current algorithms; (ii) are too artificial; (iii) are too homogeneous, not covering the wide range of characteristics found in real applications. We propose a new set of 100 instances ranging from 100 to 1000 customers, designed in order to provide a more comprehensive and balanced experimental setting. Moreover, the same generating scheme was also used to provide an extended benchmark of 600 instances. In addition to having a greater discriminating ability to identify “which algorithm is better”, these new benchmarks should also allow for a deeper statistical analysis of the performance of an algorithm. In particular, they will enable one to investigate how the characteristics of an instance affect its performance. We report such an analysis on state-of-the-art exact and heuristic methods.},
